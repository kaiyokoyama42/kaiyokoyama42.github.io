If you asked why I chose to major in MIS the primary reason would have to be that it paired well with Accounting. Some of the classes needed for both fit nicely and I also had an interest in information systems. After all I have interacted with the technology for a majority of my life. Getting to know more about them cannot be a bad thing. There is also the fact that having two majors together can give a me slight edge against others who might only focus on only one.
